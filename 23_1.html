    Gaius Julius Caesar[a] (12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. 
    A member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before 
    defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war. He subsequently became dictator from 
    49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC. Caesar played a critical role in the events that led 
    to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.
